 this is the last giver to recover their donations, the payment transaction
 must use the CloseRemainderTo attribute to close out the escrow. 

 This part of the smart contract checks for the following conditions.
. There are two transactions in the group.
. The smart contract caller is the payment transaction receiver.
. The sender of the payment transaction is the escrow
. The end date for the fund has passed
. The fund goal was missed.
. Add the payment transaction amount with the payment transaction fee and
    verify that it is equal to or less than the original given amount.
Check to see if this is the last donation to recover. If so,
   verify CloseRemainderTo is set, which will close out the escrow. */
